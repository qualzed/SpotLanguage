# .Spot Lang

I wrote the programming language purely for myself, mostly out of boredom.
I'll note that most of the parser (approximately 80%) was written by the AI.
Personally, I wrote a command using void for code parsing, encoding in the parser (which can be large), and the parser itself, including header.hpp, which reads the code, as I wrote most of the neural network. I'm not sure where you can use it, as it's an interpreted language for now. Perhaps I could make it compilable using two functions via G++, or maybe I'll find another way.
